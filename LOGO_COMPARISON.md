## 🎯 Recommendation: **Logo 1 (Chain Link)**

   - Black and white match our iOS-inspired minimalist aesthetic
   - No gradients = cleaner, more minimal

   - Chain link = connection, partnership, support
   - Perfect metaphor for fitness journey with a companion

3. **Versatility** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - Works in black & white
   - Can be simplified for small sizes (just hexagon outline)
   - Easier to print, embroider, etc.

4. **Professional Appeal** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

5. **Long-term Scalability** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
